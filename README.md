# A (non-)curated list of tools, libraries, etc., about Python and Machine/Deep learning

Just a bunch of stuff that I keep here instead of as bookmarks so that I don't forget - libraries that are not that common, e.g., Pytorch...

- [torchlayers](https://github.com/szymonmaszke/torchlayers): Shape and dimension inference (Keras-like) for PyTorch layers and neural networks

- [torchtyping](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/torchtyping): Type annotations and dynamic checking for a tensor's shape, dtype, names, etc.

- [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/deepspeed#installation): A deep learning optimization library that makes distributed training easy, efficient, and effective.

- [accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate): A simple way to train and use PyTorch models with multi-GPU, TPU, mixed-precision

- [python-patterns](https://github.com/faif/python-patterns): A collection of design patterns/idioms in Python.

- [pytorchvideo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorchvideo): A deep learning library for video understanding research.

- [AlphaPose](https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose/tree/pytorch): Real-Time and Accurate Full-Body Multi-Person Pose Estimation&Tracking System.

- [Click](https://github.com/pallets/click): Python composable command line interface toolkit.
